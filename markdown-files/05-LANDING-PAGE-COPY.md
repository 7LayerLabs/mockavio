## Problem Statement Section

### Headline
**Your Clients Can't See What You See**

### Pain Points (3 columns)

**Column 1: Real Estate**
"Empty rooms don't sell. Traditional staging costs $2,000+ per property. Virtual staging companies take 48 hours and charge $50 per image. You need results now, not next week."

**Column 2: Interior Design**
"Clients can't visualize your design concepts. Creating mockups takes hours. Change orders kill your margins. One 'I don't like that color' costs you hundreds."

**Column 3: Restaurants**
"Menu photography costs $2,000 per shoot. Seasonal changes need new photos. Social media needs constant content. You can't afford a shoot every month."
