- Average agent: 10 listings/year = $10,000/year
- Professional staging: $2,000-5,000/listing

**Mockavio Cost:**
- Starter: $99/mo × 12 = $1,188/year
- Professional: $299/mo × 12 = $3,588/year

**Savings:**
- Starter: $10,000 - $1,188 = **$8,812/year saved**
- Professional: $10,000 - $3,588 = **$6,412/year saved**

**Break-even:** First listing (Starter), Second listing (Professional)

**Additional Value:**

**Savings:**
- If Mockavio prevents just 2 change orders/year: $7,000 saved

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring
**Strategy:** Show Enterprise pricing first or show "traditional cost" before Mockavio price

**Example:**
> "Traditional staging: $2,000/listing"
> "Mockavio: $99/month unlimited"

### Decoy Effect
**Strategy:** Make Professional plan look best by comparison

**Visual:**
```
Starter       Professional ⭐    Enterprise
$99/mo        $299/mo             $999/mo
500 images    2,000 images        Unlimited
Basic         BEST VALUE          Custom
```

### Loss Aversion
**Messaging:** Focus on what they're losing without Mockavio

> "Every unstaged listing is costing you $2,000 in staging fees"
> "Every change order is eating 30% of your profit margin"

### Scarcity (for launches)
**Limited-time offers:**
- "First 100 customers: 50% off first 3 months"
- "Beta pricing: Lock in $199 Professional (normally $299)"
- "Early adopter rate: $79 Starter for life"

---

## Upgrade Paths

### Starter → Professional

**Triggers:**
1. User hits 500 image limit
2. User tries to invite team member
3. User requests white label export
4. User creates 3rd project (collaboration indicator)

**Messaging:**
> "You've used 450/500 images this month. Upgrade to Professional for 2,000 images + white label exports for just $200 more."

**Conversion Rate Target:** 25% of Starter users upgrade within 3 months

---

### Professional → Enterprise

**Triggers:**
1. Team grows beyond 5 users
2. User hits 2,000 image limit consistently
3. User requests custom integration
4. High API usage (approaching 100/hr limit)

**Messaging:**
> "Your team is growing! Let's chat about Enterprise pricing to support unlimited users and custom integrations."

**Conversion Rate Target:** 10% of Professional users upgrade within 6 months

---

## Discounting Strategy

### When to Discount
✅ Beta/launch period (50% off first 3 months)
✅ Annual commitment (2 months free = 17% discount)
✅ Large teams (volume pricing for 10+ users)
✅ Non-profits or educators (20% off)
✅ Competitive win-back (match competitor pricing)

### When NOT to Discount
❌ Individual price negotiations (devalues product)
❌ Month-to-month plans (no commitment)
❌ After customer already said yes (leaves value on table)
❌ Below cost (Starter at $49 wouldn't be sustainable)

### Coupon Codes
- `LAUNCH50` - 50% off first 3 months (beta period)
- `ANNUAL2024` - 2 months free on annual
- `MENUSPARKS` - 20% off for MenuSparks customers
- `REALTOR25` - 25% off first month for real estate agents (landing page promo)
- `DESIGNER25` - 25% off first month for designers (landing page promo)

---

## Add-On Pricing

### Extra User Seats (Professional)
**Price:** $50/user/month

**Why:** Cost to serve additional users is minimal (same image quota), so high margin

**Example:**
- Professional: $299/mo for 5 users
- Add 3 more users: $299 + ($50 × 3) = $449/mo
- Effective cost/user: $56/user (still cheaper than separate Starter accounts at $99)

---

### Additional Image Quota
**Price:** $75/month for 1,000 additional images

**Why:** Gemini API cost is ~$0.02-0.05/image, so this is 15-38x markup = healthy margin

**Example:**
- Starter: 500 images for $99
- Add 1,000 more: $99 + $75 = $174/mo for 1,500 images
- Still cheaper than Professional at $299, encourages upgrade

**Alternative:** Offer overage pricing
- First 100 over quota: Free warning
- Next 100: $0.15/image = $15
- After 200 over: Must upgrade or blocked

---

### API Rate Limit Increase
**Price:** $100/month for 10x rate limit increase

**Professional:** 100/hr → 1,000/hr for $100 more
**Enterprise:** 1,000/hr → 10,000/hr for $500 more

**Why:** High-volume API users get immense value, can pay premium

---

## Free Trial Strategy

### Trial Length: 14 Days

**Why 14 days:**
- Long enough to experience value
- Short enough to create urgency
- Industry standard for B2B SaaS

### Trial Includes:
- Full access to Professional plan features
- 100 images during trial (enough to test, not enough to abuse)
- No credit card required upfront
- Email reminders on Day 7 and Day 12

### Conversion Tactics:
**Day 3:** "Getting Started" email with tutorial
**Day 7:** "You're halfway through! Here's what you might have missed"
**Day 10:** "Only 4 days left! Upgrade now and save 20%"
**Day 12:** "Last chance! Your trial ends in 2 days"
**Day 14:** Trial ends, prompt to upgrade

**Target Conversion Rate:** 15-20% trial-to-paid

---

## Refund Policy

### 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee

**Terms:**
- Full refund within 30 days of first payment
- No questions asked
- Keep any work created during trial/first month

**Why:**
- Reduces purchase friction

## Pricing Experiments to Run

### Month 1-3: Validate Price Points
**Test:** Does anyone convert at $99? At $299?
**Metric:** Conversion rate by plan
**Hypothesis:** Professional will be most popular (60% of signups)
**Action:** If Starter dominates (>70%), increase value of Professional or lower price

### Month 4-6: Optimize Trial Length
**Test:** 7 day vs 14 day vs 30 day trial
**Metric:** Trial-to-paid conversion rate
**Hypothesis:** 14 days is optimal (7 too short, 30 too long)
**Action:** Stick with 14 or adjust based on data

### Month 7-9: Test Annual Discount
**Test:** 2 months free vs 3 months free vs 20% off
**Metric:** Annual vs monthly split
**Hypothesis:** Bigger discount increases annual adoption
**Action:** If <20% choose annual, increase discount

### Month 10-12: Enterprise Pricing Optimization
**Test:** Different starting prices for Enterprise ($999 vs $1,499 vs custom)
**Metric:** Close rate on Enterprise deals
**Hypothesis:** Custom pricing works better than posted price
**Action:** Refine based on sales conversations
