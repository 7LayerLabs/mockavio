## Messaging Framework

### For Real Estate Agents
**Pain:** "Staging costs $2,000+ per listing, limits how many properties I can list attractively"

**Solution:** "Transform empty rooms into furnished spaces in 60 seconds. Show buyers the potential, not just the problem."

**Proof:** "Sarah M. saved $12,000 in staging costs last quarter and closed 2 deals faster by showing renovation potential"

**Call-to-Action:** "Start your 14-day free trial. No credit card required."

### For Interior Designers
**Pain:** "Clients can't visualize concepts until I build expensive mockups. Change orders kill my margins."

**Solution:** "Show 10 design variations instantly. Walk clients through styles before committing to purchases."

**Proof:** "Jamie R. eliminated 80% of change orders by presenting AI mockups during initial consultations"

**Call-to-Action:** "See your portfolio in new styles. Start free trial."

### For Restaurants
**Pain:** "Menu photos cost $2,000+ per shoot. Social media needs constant fresh content but I can't afford monthly shoots."

**Solution:** "Transform 1 photoshoot into 50+ variations. Test seasonal plates, plating styles, and marketing angles digitally."

**Proof:** "The Grove Kitchen created 6 months of social content from a single shoot day. $8,000 saved, 3x more content."

**Call-to-Action:** "Transform your menu photos. Try free for 14 days."
